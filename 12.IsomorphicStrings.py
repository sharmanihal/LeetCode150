Explanation:

    1. The isIsomorphic function checks if two strings s and t are isomorphic (i.e., characters in s can be replaced to get t).
    2. If the two strings are equal, they are considered isomorphic, so the function returns True in that case.
    3. Two hashmaps (hashmap_s and hashmap_t) are used to track the mappings of characters between the two strings.
    4. The function iterates through the characters of the strings using a for loop.
    5. Inside the loop:
        * It checks for mapping conflicts in t and s hashmaps. If a conflict is found, the function returns False.
        * If no conflicts are found, it updates the hashmaps with the character mappings.
    6. If the loop completes without returning False, the strings are considered isomorphic, and the function returns True.

This solution efficiently determines if two strings are isomorphic by tracking character mappings between them using hashmaps.
