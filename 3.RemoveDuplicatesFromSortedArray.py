Explanation:

1. The code uses two pointers, `i` and `j`, to iterate through the array. `i` is the current position being checked, and `j` is the position where unique elements will be updated.

2. The variable `num` is initialized to the first element of the array, assuming it's unique.

3. The main loop continues until the end of the array is reached.

4. Inside the loop, it checks if the current element (`nums[i]`) is different from the previously encountered unique element (`num`).

5. If they are different, it updates the unique element to the current element, updates the array at position `j` with the unique element, and moves the pointer `j` to the next position.

6. Regardless of whether the current element is unique or not, it moves the pointer `i` to the next position.

7. The final result is the count of unique elements, which is represented by the value of `j`.
