Explanation:

- The `isPalindrome` function checks if a given string `s` is a palindrome after some transformations.
- It uses two pointers, `i` starting from the beginning and `j` starting from the end of the string.
- The function iterates until the pointers meet or cross each other (`i < j`).
- Inside the loop:
  - It advances the left pointer (`i`) to the next alphanumeric character using the `isalnum()` method.
  - It advances the right pointer (`j`) to the next alphanumeric character using the `isalnum()` method.
  - It checks if the characters at the current pointers are not equal (case-insensitive). If they are not equal, the string is not a palindrome, and it returns `False`.
  - It then moves the pointers towards the center.
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, the string is considered a palindrome, and it returns `True`.

This solution handles cases where a palindrome might contain non-alphanumeric characters and is not case-sensitive.
