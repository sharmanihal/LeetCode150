Explanation:

1. Binary Search Logic:
   - The code is implementing a binary search algorithm to find the target or determine its insertion position.

2. Initialization:
   - `start` and `end` pointers are initialized to the beginning and end of the array, respectively.

3. Binary Search Loop:
   - The while loop continues as long as the `start` pointer is less than or equal to the `end` pointer.

4. Midpoint Calculation:
   - The midpoint (`mid`) of the current search range is calculated.

5. Comparison with Target:
   - If the value at the midpoint is equal to the target, the function returns the midpoint as the index where the target is found.

6. Adjusting Search Range:
   - If the value at the midpoint is greater than the target, the search is narrowed to the left half by updating the `end` pointer.
   - If the value at the midpoint is smaller than the target, the search is narrowed to the right half by updating the `start` pointer.

7. Exit Condition:
   - The loop continues until the search range is exhausted (when `start` becomes greater than `end`).

8. Return Statement:
   - If the target is not found, the function returns the `start` pointer, which represents the index where the target should be inserted in order to maintain the sorted order.

The time complexity of this solution is O(log n) because it uses binary search, and the space complexity is O(1) as it only uses a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
