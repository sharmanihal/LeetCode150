Explanation:

We set the initial goal to reach the last index of the array.
We iterate through the array backwards to analyze each index.
At each step, we check if the current index plus the maximum jump from it can reach or surpass our current goal.
If it can, we update the goal to be the current index, as it becomes a new potential endpoint.
Finally, if the goal has reached the start index (0), it means we can reach the last index, so we return True; otherwise, we return False.
class Solution:
    def canJump(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        # Set the initial goal to reach the end of the array.
        goal = len(nums) - 1
        
        # Traverse the array backwards to analyze each index.
        for i in range(len(nums) - 1, -1, -1):
            # Check if the current index plus the maximum jump from it can reach or surpass the current goal.
            if i + nums[i] >= goal:
                # If so, update the goal to be the current index, as it becomes a new potential endpoint.
                goal = i
        
        # If the goal has reached the start index (0), it means we can reach the last index.
        return goal == 0
