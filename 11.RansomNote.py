Explanation:

- The `canConstruct` function checks if the `ransom_note` can be constructed using the letters from the `magazine`.
- It uses a dictionary (`magazine_char_frequency`) to store the frequency of each character in the `magazine`.
- It first populates the dictionary with the frequency of each character in the `magazine`.
- Then, it iterates through each character in the `ransom_note`:
  - If the character is not in the `magazine` or its frequency is already 0, it means the character cannot be used, so the function returns `False`.
  - Otherwise, it decreases the frequency of the character in the `magazine`.
- If the loop completes, it means all characters in the `ransom_note` have corresponding characters in the `magazine`, and their frequencies allow constructing the `ransom_note`. In this case, the function returns `True`.

This solution efficiently checks whether `ransom_note` can be constructed from the characters in `magazine`.
